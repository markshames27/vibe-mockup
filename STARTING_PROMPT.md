# Starting Prompt for Vibe Mockup Workflow

Use this prompt to begin a new project with the Vibe Mockup Workflow:

```
I have an idea for a new web application. I want you to help me refine the idea, create a user flow, and generate mockups for it.

My idea is: [Your application idea here]

Please follow the Vibe Mockup Workflow defined at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/markshames27/vibe-mockup

Follow the guidelines and instructions in the README. Start with the first skill, "idea-refinement_v1.md", and guide me through the process of creating a Lean Canvas for my idea.
```

## Instructions

1. Replace `[Your application idea here]` with your actual idea
2. Paste the complete prompt into your AI assistant
3. Follow the AI's guidance through each skill
4. Type "save session" at any point to save your progress to GitHub
5. The AI will guide you through all three skills sequentially

## What to Expect

The workflow will take you through:
1. **Idea Refinement** (15-30 min) - Create a Lean Canvas
2. **User Flow Visualization** (20-40 min) - Map the user journey
3. **Mockup Generation** (30-60 min) - Design screen mockups

Total time: 1-2 hours for a complete project specification.
