# Idea Refinement Skill

## Overview

This skill guides you through creating a Lean Canvas for your idea. The Lean Canvas is a 1-page business plan template that helps you deconstruct your idea into its key assumptions.

## Process

I will ask you clarifying questions for each of the 9 sections below. Provide thoughtful, concise answers.

### 1. Problem
What is the problem you are trying to solve? Who experiences this problem?

### 2. Customer Segments
Who are your primary target customers?

### 3. Unique Value Proposition
What makes your solution unique and valuable? Why would customers choose you?

### 4. Solution
Describe your solution in simple terms. What is the core offering?

### 5. Channels
How will you reach your customers?

### 6. Revenue Streams
How will you generate revenue? What is your pricing model?

### 7. Cost Structure
What are your main costs (fixed and variable)?

### 8. Key Metrics
What metrics will you track to measure success?

### 9. Unfair Advantage
What gives you an unfair advantage that can't be easily copied?

## Output

I will provide a completed Lean Canvas in a structured format that you can reference throughout your project.

## Next Steps

Once complete, move to the user-flow-visualization skill to map out how users interact with your product.
