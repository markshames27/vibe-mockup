# Vibe Mockup Workflow

A modular workflow for building web application mockups with AI assistance.

## Skills

1. **idea-refinement.md** - Create a Lean Canvas for your idea
2. **user-flow-visualization.md** - Map out user journeys with ASCII art
3. **mockup-generation.md** - Generate screen mockups

## Quick Start

To begin, use this prompt with your AI assistant:

```
I have an idea for a new web application. I want you to help me refine the idea, create a user flow, and generate mockups for it.

My idea is: [Your application idea here]

Please follow the Vibe Mockup Workflow defined at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/markshames27/vibe-mockup

Start with the first skill, "idea-refinement.md", and guide me through the process of creating a Lean Canvas for my idea.
```

Replace `[Your application idea here]` with your actual idea and start the workflow.
